Interview summary:
This interview was conducted on October 7, 2005 at 2501 16th Street, Denver with Carlo Amato.  The interviewer was Colorado Historical Society volunteer Frank Palmeri.  Carlo begins the interview by stating his birth date in 1948, and outlining the history of how his family came to the United States from Italy.  He starts with the story of his grandfather, also named Carlo Amato, who came to the US in 1921 to be with his brother.  Age 35 when he immigrated, grandfather Carlo was already a master cabinet maker, and started a long running business in cabinets and furniture.  He opened his first shop near Mt. Carmel Church, on Navajo Street.  Later in the 1920s he married his wife, Lillian Lombardi; they had two children, Rose and Frank (the interviewee’s father).  Carlo continues the interview discussing his grandfather’s shift toward statuary business starting in the late 1940s, and his work up until his retirement in 1976.  Carlo also describes his father’s own work in upholstery, which came out of his grandfather’s experience in cabinet making.  


Carlo spends the final portion of the interview describing his schooling at Mt. Carmel and North High School, and the work he did with his grandfather and father before he graduated in 1966.  Carlo went on to continue his grandfather’s statuary business in 1976, and he discusses his national business ventures and mentors in those endeavors.  The interview concludes with Carlo describing the Italian community in North Denver, and his family’s involvement with the Sons of Italy fraternal organization out of the Potenza Lodge.

Interview summary:
This interview was conducted on April 10, 1930 with Maxine Berlinger at her home.  The interviewer was  A.C. Iannacito.  The interview begins with Maxine giving information about her birth in 1930, and her full, Italian name, Rubina Maxine Berlinger.  Maxine then discusses her parents and how they immigrated to the United States.  Maxine’s father, Benjamin Berlinger was born in 1896, and immigrated to the United States at age 7 where he was raised by his four brothers.  He and his brothers lived in Montana, where they worked in the Copper mines .  Gaining a sixth grade education, Benjamin was a self-taught engineer; he enlisted in the military during World War I, and later returned to Montana where he married his wife, Rose around 1920.  Benjamin moved to Colorado with his family in 1923 to be a bricklayer, and had four children.  He later worked for Nabisco to use his engineering skills.

The latter part of the interview focuses mostly on Maxine’s professional career as a nurse and nursing academic.  Maxine graduated from North High School in Denver in 1948, then went on to Loretto Heights College to go to nursing school.  She later received her Master’s Degree in nursing from the University of Chicago in 1959, where Maxine recalls being chosen as the youngest ever nursing candidate directly by nationally renowned nurse Florence Blake to attend.  Maxine also remembers her extensive work history in nursing, where she worked as a nurse, nursing professor, dean, and administrator at the University of Colorado School of Nursing, University of Colorado General Hospital Pediatrics wing, and off and on at the University of Hawaii School of Nursing.  Maxine retired in 1986, though she continued working in nursing in various positions until 1994.  The interview concludes with Maxine’s various memories of the Italian community in Denver, including her meeting of the Pope in 1994, and discussions of family photographs and artifacts.
